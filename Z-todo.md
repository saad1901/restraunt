## SINGLE OUTLET
- add another user type, cashier , can be created by owner itself from login


## MULTI OUTLET
- multi outlet application user type (superadmin, admin, cashiers of each outlet, waiters of outlets, agents)
- or we can design a seperate application for that? cause current one is developed with single outlet in the mind, 
  re designing just for mutli outlet will require one extra page after login, asking for which outlet to select? 
  but such chains often use custom made softwares and may not be interested in ours? 
  for as of now, I will stick to single outlet systems. GoodLuck.
